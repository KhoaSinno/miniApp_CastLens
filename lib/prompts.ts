// PRIORITY:
// - If the latest user turn is a direct fact question (e.g., "X là ai / Who is X?"):
//   1) If ENRICHED_KNOWLEDGE is present, answer directly from it first (with source names).
//   2) If not present, say you don't have enough context from the cast and ask if the user wants you to look it up on the web. Do not guess.\
//   return {"content": "Not enough context from the cast. Do you want me to look it up on the web?"}
